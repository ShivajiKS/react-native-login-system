# Project Title

Our system includes the ability to sign up, login, reset forgotten passwords, update email addresses, change passwords, logout, and even delete accounts. Additionally, users can add, update, and remove addresses, making it easy to keep their contact information up to date. 


- To ensure data integrity and prevent security breaches, we implemented form validation using Formik and Yup. We also chose Firebase as our backend platform, which provides a scalable and secure infrastructure for storing user data.
  
- To enhance the user interface, we used Tailwind CSS for styling, allowing us to quickly and easily customize the design and layout of the login system.
  
- Our system ensures data integrity while providing an excellent user experience.
